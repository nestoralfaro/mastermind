<set>: It was needed to avoid duplicates when inserting every wrong place in a set.
<climits>: Helped to enter a combination within the boundaries of pegs and colors, even if the input is out of those bounds.

-	(Optional) Any shortcomings of your project: What were you unable to get working? Why could you not get it working? What is needed to finish the project?
I thank God, the project seems to be working and at least stable enough to pass several test cases.

-	(Optional) Any strengths of your project: ways in which your program goes above and beyond the basic requirements.
Combination validation: Even though it does not validate when an input is not a number (as it was not required), it really does well when validating a combination, even 
if the input is out of bounds.

-	Write a few sentences explaining how you used classes in your project. 
I only used one class named "Mastermind" which contains all the methods (functions) and struct data types necessary to run the program. They made it easy to exchange functions and data between
them since they were in the same class.

-	How did you decide what classes to make? 
By trying to figuring out the way I wanted my code to look like. I really wanted to use more than one class and play with it, but I did not have time. 

-	How did they help you? 
It made it easier to debug and understand the code.

-	If you didn't use classes, why didn't you?
I decided to use a class.
